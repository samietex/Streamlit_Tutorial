# Streamlit Tutorial Repository

Welcome to the Streamlit Tutorial Repository! This repository is your one-stop destination to learn about Streamlit, the open-source app framework that turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.

## What is Streamlit?

Streamlit is an incredibly easy-to-use framework that allows you to create beautiful, interactive web applications for data analysis and visualization without the need for complex web development skills. It's perfect for data scientists and engineers who want to showcase their projects or for anyone interested in creating data-driven apps with ease.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured into three main sections, each containing a unique demo application ranging from a simple exploratory data analysis project, data science project, to an OpenAI ChatGPT clone complete with source code and detailed tutorial documentation:

| Demo Number | Title                        | Description                                                          |
|-------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Demo 1      | [Data Exploration and Visualization App](/Adidas/Adidas.ipynb)         | Dive into data exploration with interactive widgets to filter and visualize datasets. |
| Demo 2      | [Machine Learning Visualization](/SuperStore/sales_dashboard.ipynb) | See how Streamlit can be used to visualize machine learning model operations. |
| Demo 3      | [Streamlit LLM App](/Streamlit_OpenAI/llm.ipynb)  | Learn to build an app that tracks data in real-time with user input and updates. |


Each demo directory contains:
- A Jupyter notebook file with step-by-step instructions specific to the demo, and how you can replicate the streamlit app.
- A `requirements.txt` file listing the necessary Python packages.
- A python script that contains the Streamlit app code.
- Additional resources like datasets or model files if applicable.
