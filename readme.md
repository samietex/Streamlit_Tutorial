# Streamlit Tutorial Repository

Welcome to the Streamlit Tutorial Repository! This repository is your one-stop destination to learn about Streamlit, the open-source app framework that turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.

## What is Streamlit?

Streamlit is an incredibly easy-to-use framework that allows you to create beautiful, interactive web applications for data analysis and visualization without the need for complex web development skills. It's perfect for data scientists and engineers who want to showcase their projects or for anyone interested in creating data-driven apps with ease.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured into three main sections, each containing a unique demo application ranging from a simple exploratory data analysis project, data science project, to an OpenAI ChatGPT clone complete with source code and detailed tutorial documentation:

| Demo Number | Title                        | Description                                                          |
|-------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
